# USING DEEP LEARNING AND SATELLITE IMAGERY TO PREDICT ROAD SAFETY
This paper expands on previous work combining satellite imagery and deep learning to predict road safety. Studies have supported the proposition that features of the built environment impact city-scale issues and can be observed through satellite imagery. In this paper, data was collected and combined to generate a labelled dataset of satellite imagery for the City of Toronto. Class balancing techniques were then used to mitigate model bias. The best performing technique was used for the experiments. A Convolution Neural Network (CNN) was trained for overall road accidents, pedestrian accidents and cyclist accidents. Each CNN model followed the ResNet50 framework and pre-trained on ImageNet. The resulting high accuracy scores and low macro F1 scores indicate a sensitivity towards the majority class. The models were able to use observable features of the built environment to predict ‘highly safe’ regions but show poor performance on regions labelled has ‘highly risky’.
